      *** WORKOUT STRATEGY Based on Level (${userData.level}) ***
      ${levelInstructions}

      *** EQUIPMENT STRATEGY Based on Location (${userData.location}) ***
      ${locationInstructions}

      *** IMPORTANT DIETARY GUIDELINES (Indian Context) ***
      - All meals must be authentic Indian dishes.
      - For "Non-Veg": Balanced mix (40-50% Veg, rest Non-Veg).
      - For "Veg + Non-Veg": Explicitly mostly Veg with 3-4 Non-Veg meals/week.
      - For "Veg": High protein Vegetarian (Paneer, Soya, Dal, Legumes).
      - For "Vegan": Plant-based Indian (Tofu, Lentils, Chana).
      - For "Keto": Low carb Indian (Paneer/Chicken/Fish tikka, Leafy greens, Ghee).
      - Use Indian cooking styles (Curry, Tandoori, Stir-fry).
      
      *** CALORIE & MACRO GUIDELINES (CRITICAL) ***
      - TARGET CALORIES: 1800 - 2500+ kcal (Never below 1500 unless specifically requested).
      - Ensure portions are realistic for an adult human.
      - Breakfast: ~400-600 kcal.
      - Lunch: ~700-900 kcal.
      - Dinner: ~600-800 kcal.
      - Snack: ~200-400 kcal.

      *** MEAL COMPOSITION RULES (Complete Indian Meals) ***
      - LUNCH & DINNER MUST BE COMPLETE MEALS, consisting of:
        1. Main Protein/Curry (Dal, Paneer, Chicken, Fish, etc.)
        2. Carbohydrate Source (2-3 Rotis, large bowl Rice)
        3. Side Dish (Sabzi/Dry Veg)
        4. Fiber/Probiotic (Salad, Cucumber, Curd/Raita)
      - Example: "Paneer Butter Masala (1 bowl) + 3 Chapatis + Bhindi Fry + Green Salad"
      - DO NOT suggest single items like "1 bowl dal" or "Grilled Chicken" alone.
      
      *** CRITICAL RULES FOR VARIETY & USABILITY ***
      1. NO REPETITION: Every day must feel unique. Do not repeat the same exact meal structure.
      2. PROGRESSION: The workout should feel like a structured week, not random exercises.
      3. REALISM: Ensure the diet is practical for an Indian household.
      4. USABILITY:
         - Beginner: Keep it simple, 2 sets.
         - Intermediate/Advanced: Ramp up volume to 3-4 sets.
